# Sizzling-Sklearn

Purpose of this repository is to capture all the best features available within Scikit-Learn library in Python. Most data scientists use Sklearn for machine learning jobs only, though it also provides many other useful features for data processing, model training and model evaluation. I would be submitting multiple notebooks in this repository with sole aim of capturing all useful features of this amazing library.
